How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Through static testing and dynamic testing I can ensure my code is funtional and secure. I can review my code through powerful
  editors such as eclipse that highlight errors as I go. I can use JUnit tests to automate my testing and test for software requirements. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Documentation is important in any project. I would like to speak with the consumer as much as possible to have a very detailed
  requirements document that outlines the software requirments. Using this documentation I can then translate them into code that
  closely follows these requirments.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  Desiging software requires some form of planning. Sometimes I like to create very simple psuedcode. This psuedocode simply extracts
  the software requirments and puts it into something that makes sense in a program. After that I design methods to complete each
  requirment and then overall software that can access and use those methods.
